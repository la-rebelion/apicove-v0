# API Cove

APICove is a hub for industry standard APIs. It is a platform that enables developes to find the most important APIs that are widely used in the industry. It provides a brief description of the APIs and their use cases. It also provides a link to the official documentation of the APIs.

Different to other API directories, APICove focuses on APIs that are widely used in the industry. It provides a curated list of APIs that are essential for developers to know. The goal of APICove is to provide a platform where developers can find the most important APIs in one place, but not only the documentation, it provides Simulators to test the APIs and also provides a list of tutorials and resources to learn more about the APIs.

Is there an API that you think should be included in the list? Feel free to create a pull request and add it to the list.
